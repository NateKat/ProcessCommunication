# ProcessCommunication
Two processes will communicate over a socket. (Randomly generated) vectors from the first process will be sent to the second process. These "data" vectors should be accumulated in the second process in a matrix. Some simple statistics will be computed (across the "temporal" dimension). Results are saved to a file
